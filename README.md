- 👋 Hi, I’m @mmelonas
  
- 👀 I’m interested in anything related to computers!
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to becomea DevOps Specialist.
      My background is mostly Operations (Ops), but I am learning
      how to automate redundant tasks with programming in Bash,
      Ansible, Python, C#, and PowerShell.

      to solve real problems thereby enriching everyone in the process.
