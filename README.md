- 👋 Hi, I’m @mmelonas
  
- 👀 I’m interested in anything related to computers!
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to become a DevOps Specialist.
      My background is mostly Operations (Ops), but I am learning
      how to automate redundant tasks by programming in Bash,
      Ansible, Python, C#, Golang, and PowerShell.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how to integrate technology solutions
      to solve real problems thereby enriching everyone in the process.

- 📫 How to reach me: Here on Github you can follow me, and I am also on 
      LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/in/michaelmelonas
      Also, check out my repository for PowerShell! I hope it can help you out!
